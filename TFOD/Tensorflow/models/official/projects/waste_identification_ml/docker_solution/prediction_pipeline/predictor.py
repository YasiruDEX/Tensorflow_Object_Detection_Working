"""This is a prediction script.

For sending images to a FastAPI server and receiving predictions from a Mask
R-CNN model. The FastAPI server, powered by Uvicorn, hosts the Mask R-CNN model
which performs instance segmentation.

The script leverages the 'requests' library to send HTTP POST requests, carrying
images to the FastAPI server. The server processes these images using the
Mask R-CNN model and returns prediction results which are then postprocessed.

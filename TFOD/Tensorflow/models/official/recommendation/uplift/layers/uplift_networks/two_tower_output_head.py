  This layer is intended to be used in conjunction with a two tower uplift
  network layer to compute training and inference outputs. It passes the input
  dictionary of feature tensors to the uplift network and computes training and
  inference tensors from the uplift network's outputs.

  The control, treatment, and uplift predictions are computed from the uplift
  network's control and treatment logits. Additionally, if the treatment
  indicator tensor is part of the inputs, the true logits are also computed to
  be used for loss computation. The treatment indicator tensor should therefore
  be present in the inputs dictionary during training and evaluation.
